🧭 Phase 4B — UI Expansion (Authoritative Plan)

Phase 4B Objective (Locked)

Complete the Admin-facing UI layer of WebWaka as pure declarative consumers of the already-ratified control cores.

This phase does NOT:
	•	introduce business logic
	•	introduce new permissions/entitlements/flags
	•	reimplement control engines
	•	touch Core or Control repos

⸻

Phase 4B Sub-Phases (Strict Order)

Phase 4B-1 — Super Admin Dashboard UI

Status: ⏭️ STARTING NOW
Purpose: Platform-wide governance & observability UI
Repo: webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-ui
Platform: Replit (UI + GitHub push + Vercel auto-deploy)

⸻

Phase 4B-2 — Partner Dashboard UI

Pure consumer of:
	•	Core Dashboard Control
	•	Partner Control Declarations

⸻

Phase 4B-3 — Tenant Dashboard UI

Pure consumer of:
	•	Core Dashboard Control
	•	Tenant Control Declarations

⸻

✅ Why Replit Is the Correct Platform (Final)
	•	Reliable GitHub clone & push
	•	Predictable Next.js behavior
	•	Deterministic CI control
	•	No hidden scaffolding
	•	Works cleanly with Vercel

Lovable ❌ (cannot clone repos)
Emergent ❌ (over-scaffolds, mismatched stack)

⸻

🚀 PHASE 4B-1 — REPLIT EXECUTION PROMPT

(Copy–Paste Exactly as Is)

⸻

CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY)

You are executing Phase 4B-1 — Super Admin Dashboard UI for the WebWaka platform.

This is a UI-ONLY IMPLEMENTATION.

🚫 DO NOT implement business logic
🚫 DO NOT define permissions, entitlements, or feature flags
🚫 DO NOT reimplement control engines
🚫 DO NOT scaffold anything before cloning

⸻

REPOSITORY (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

Repository:
https://github.com/changerplanet/webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-ui

🔴 CRITICAL
	1.	Clone the repository FIRST
	2.	If the repo is empty:
	•	Clone it as-is
	•	Do NOT add any placeholder files
	3.	If Replit auto-adds files:
	•	DELETE everything added
	•	Ensure the repo state matches GitHub exactly before proceeding

If the repo cannot be cloned exactly → STOP and report

⸻

SOURCE OF TRUTH (IMMUTABLE)

WebWaka Ecosystem Constitution v1.5+

Mandatory principles:
	•	Nigeria-first (₦ only)
	•	Mobile-first UI
	•	UI is a pure consumer
	•	All visibility & access flows through Phase 4A
	•	Deterministic outputs
	•	Offline-safe snapshots
	•	No demo data

⸻

REQUIRED CONTROL DEPENDENCIES

Consume ONLY these (via GitHub):

{
  "dependencies": {
    "webwaka-core-dashboard-control": "github:changerplanet/webwaka-core-dashboard-control",
    "webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-control": "github:changerplanet/webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-control"
  }
}


⸻

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

1️⃣ Single Control Consumer (MANDATORY)

Create:

src/lib/control-consumer.ts

This must be the ONLY file importing control logic.

No other file may import:
	•	permissions
	•	entitlements
	•	feature flags
	•	dashboard declarations

⸻

2️⃣ UI Structure

Implement a Next.js 14 (App Router) UI with:
	•	Collapsible sidebar
	•	Section-based navigation
	•	Mobile-first responsive layout
	•	Section landing pages (no fake data)
	•	“Controlled by Core” indicators (non-functional, visual only)

⸻

3️⃣ Visibility Rules (STRICT)

All section visibility must be resolved via:

resolveDashboard(...)

❌ No role checks
❌ No if (canView)
❌ No hardcoded access rules

UI renders only what Phase 4A resolves

⸻

4️⃣ Currency & Locale
	•	Currency: ₦ (NGN) ONLY
	•	Locale: en-NG
	•	Any currency formatting must explicitly enforce NGN

⸻

5️⃣ Determinism
	•	No Date.now()
	•	No random values
	•	All evaluations use explicit timestamps

⸻

6️⃣ Tests (REQUIRED)

Write tests proving:
	•	Visibility changes when control input changes
	•	Determinism (10× same input → same output)
	•	Snapshot parity (online vs offline)
	•	No UI file imports control logic except control-consumer.ts

⸻

7️⃣ Build & CI
	•	npm test must fail loudly
	•	npm run build must pass
	•	No masked commands (|| true is forbidden)

⸻

FINAL DELIVERABLE

You must provide:
	1.	Working Super Admin Dashboard UI
	2.	Tests passing
	3.	Build passing
	4.	Code pushed to main
	5.	No constitutional violations

⸻

HARD STOP

After completion:

⛔ STOP
⛔ Do NOT proceed to Phase 4B-2
⛔ Await explicit authorization

⸻

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORMAT

Reply only with:

“Phase 4B-1 acknowledged. Cloning repository and proceeding exactly as instructed.”

Then execute.
