Super Admin Dashboard UI Expansion (Structure-Only)

⸻

CONTEXT

You are implementing Phase 4B-2 of the WebWaka Modular Rebuild.

This phase expands the Super Admin Dashboard UI created in Phase 4B-1.

The control logic MUST NOT CHANGE.

All visibility, access, and gating decisions continue to be resolved exclusively by:
	•	Permissions
	•	Entitlements
	•	Feature Flags

…via Phase 4A Dashboard Control Engine ONLY.

⸻

REPOSITORY (MANDATORY)

Repo name (already exists):
webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-ui

🚨 HARD REQUIREMENT
	1.	You MUST clone this repository from GitHub before writing any code.
	2.	If the repo is not found or cannot be cloned:
	•	⛔ STOP immediately
	•	⛔ DO NOT scaffold a new project
	•	⛔ Report the issue

No local-only or parallel codebases are allowed.

⸻

SCOPE OF THIS PHASE (STRICT)

✅ YOU ARE ALLOWED TO:
	•	Add UI layout structure
	•	Add component shells
	•	Add empty pages, tables, cards, and forms
	•	Add navigation wiring
	•	Add responsive layout improvements
	•	Add design-system primitives
	•	Add placeholder copy

❌ YOU MUST NOT:
	•	Implement business logic
	•	Fetch real data
	•	Call APIs
	•	Add permissions/entitlement logic
	•	Hardcode roles
	•	Add pricing, incentives, or ledger behavior
	•	Bypass Phase 4A resolver
	•	Re-implement gating logic

This is STRUCTURE ONLY.

⸻

OBJECTIVE

Transform the Super Admin Dashboard from a “controlled shell” into a fully navigable, enterprise-grade UI skeleton, ready for future integrations.

All sections must:
	•	Render deterministically
	•	Respect snapshot-based visibility
	•	Work offline with snapshots
	•	Be explainable (why visible / hidden)

⸻

REQUIRED UI EXPANSIONS

For each existing Super Admin section, implement:

1️⃣ Section Landing Page

Each section gets:
	•	Title
	•	Description
	•	Empty state messaging
	•	Placeholder KPI cards (no data)
	•	Placeholder table or panel

Example:
	•	/platform-governance
	•	/partners
	•	/pricing
	•	/incentives
	•	/feature-flags
	•	/branding
	•	/infrastructure
	•	/audit
	•	/ai

⸻

2️⃣ Standard Layout Components (Reusable)

Create reusable components:
	•	PageLayout
	•	SectionHeader
	•	KpiPlaceholder
	•	TablePlaceholder
	•	EmptyState
	•	ComingSoonBanner

All must be pure presentational components.

⸻

3️⃣ Navigation Enhancements
	•	Sidebar grouping by domain
	•	Breadcrumbs
	•	Mobile-friendly navigation
	•	Collapsible sections
	•	Active state indicators

No logic — only rendering based on resolved dashboard output.

⸻

4️⃣ Design System Foundation

Introduce:
	•	Spacing scale
	•	Typography scale
	•	Color tokens (neutral only, branding comes later)
	•	Button variants
	•	Card variants
	•	Table styles

No tenant or partner branding yet.

⸻

5️⃣ Developer Experience Enhancements
	•	Dev toggle to show:
	•	Hidden sections
	•	Visibility reasons (already available via Phase 4A)
	•	Clear TODO markers where integrations will later attach

⸻

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
	•	Next.js App Router
	•	TypeScript strict mode
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	Jest + RTL tests must continue passing
	•	Snapshot rendering must remain unchanged
	•	No new dependencies without necessity

⸻

TESTING REQUIREMENTS

Add or update tests to prove:
	•	UI renders with snapshot input
	•	Layout renders deterministically
	•	Mobile and desktop layouts render
	•	No visibility logic exists in UI components

Tests must NOT mock permissions directly.

⸻

HARD STOP CONDITIONS

This phase is COMPLETE only if:

✅ Super Admin Dashboard is fully navigable
✅ Every section has a structured landing page
✅ UI contains zero access logic
✅ Phase 4A resolver remains the sole gatekeeper
✅ All tests pass
✅ Repo builds and deploys to Vercel successfully

⸻

DELIVERABLE

Produce a Phase 4B-2 Completion Report including:
	•	Section list + routes
	•	Component inventory
	•	Screenshots (optional)
	•	Test summary
	•	Final commit SHA

Then:

⛔ STOP
⛔ Await explicit authorization

⸻

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Reply only with:

“Acknowledged. I will clone the repo first and execute Phase 4B-2 exactly as instructed.”

Then proceed.
