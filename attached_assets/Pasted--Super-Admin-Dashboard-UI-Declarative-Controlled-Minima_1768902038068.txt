Super Admin Dashboard UI (Declarative, Controlled, Minimal UI)

⸻

CONTEXT

You are operating as Replit AI on behalf of the WebWaka Modular Platform.

This task is UI IMPLEMENTATION ONLY, strictly governed by the WebWaka Constitution and Phase 4 architecture.

🚫 You must NOT invent business logic
🚫 You must NOT hardcode roles or permissions
🚫 You must NOT bypass Phase 4A controls
🚫 You must NOT proceed unless the repo is cloned successfully

⸻

SOURCE OF TRUTH
	•	GitHub Organization: ChangerPlanet
	•	Target Repository:
👉 webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-ui
	•	Branch: main
	•	Deployment: Vercel (already configured, auto-deploy on push)
	•	Control Engine:
👉 webwaka-core-dashboard-control (Phase 4A)

⸻

🚨 HARD PRECONDITION (MANDATORY)

STEP 0 — CLONE OR STOP

You MUST do the following before writing any code:
	1.	Clone this repository from GitHub:

https://github.com/changerplanet/webwaka-suite-superadmin-dashboard-ui


	2.	Verify:
	•	Repo is present in workspace
	•	You are on branch main
	•	You have push access

❌ If the repository cannot be cloned
❌ If the repo is missing
❌ If you do not have push access

👉 STOP IMMEDIATELY and report the issue.
👉 DO NOT scaffold a new project.
👉 DO NOT write code outside the repo.

OBJECTIVE

Implement the Super Admin Dashboard UI as a thin, declarative renderer that:
	•	Consumes Phase 4B dashboard declarations
	•	Delegates all visibility decisions to Phase 4A engine
	•	Renders UI only for resolved sections
	•	Supports snapshot-based offline evaluation
	•	Is mobile-first, clean, minimal, and extensible

This UI is NOT the source of truth.
It is a pure consumer.

⸻

UI ARCHITECTURE (STRICT)

Framework
	•	Next.js (App Router)
	•	TypeScript
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	Shadcn/UI (optional, minimal)
	•	No backend server logic

Allowed Responsibilities

✅ Render dashboard layout
✅ Render sections returned by resolver
✅ Show “hidden” reason messages (explainability)
✅ Support snapshot-based rendering
✅ Responsive (mobile-first)

Forbidden Responsibilities

❌ Permission checks
❌ Entitlement checks
❌ Feature flag evaluation
❌ Role-based logic
❌ API-side business logic

⸻

REQUIRED INTEGRATION

Phase 4A Engine Usage (MANDATORY)

The UI must import and use:
	•	resolveDashboard(...)
	•	generateDashboardSnapshot(...)
	•	verifyDashboardSnapshot(...)
	•	evaluateFromSnapshot(...)

From:

webwaka-core-dashboard-control

All menu visibility MUST come from:
	•	Permissions
	•	Entitlements
	•	Feature flags

Never hardcode menu visibility.

⸻

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

1️⃣ App Skeleton
	•	Root layout
	•	Super Admin dashboard page
	•	Sidebar + main content area
	•	Mobile-first navigation (collapsible)

2️⃣ Dashboard Resolution Flow
	•	Accept DashboardContext (mocked for now)
	•	Call Phase 4A resolver
	•	Receive ResolvedDashboard
	•	Render only visible sections
	•	Display hidden sections with explanation (optional dev mode)

3️⃣ Snapshot Support
	•	Generate snapshot after resolution
	•	Verify snapshot before reuse
	•	Allow rendering from snapshot (simulate offline mode)

4️⃣ Section Rendering

For each resolved section:
	•	Render title
	•	Render placeholder panel (no business UI yet)
	•	Clearly mark as “Controlled by Core”

⸻

TESTING REQUIREMENTS

You must include tests proving:
	•	Deterministic rendering (same input = same UI)
	•	Hidden sections are not rendered
	•	Snapshot-based rendering matches live rendering
	•	No hardcoded permissions or roles exist

Target coverage: ≥80%

⸻

COMMIT & DEPLOYMENT
	1.	Commit directly to main
	2.	Push to GitHub
	3.	Confirm Vercel auto-deployment triggered
	4.	Report Preview URL

⸻

REQUIRED FINAL REPORT

When complete, respond with:

A. GitHub
	•	Repo name
	•	Commit SHA
	•	Files added/modified

B. Vercel
	•	Preview deployment URL
	•	Confirmation auto-deploy worked

C. Guarantees

Explicit confirmation that:
	•	❌ No hardcoded roles
	•	❌ No permission logic in UI
	•	✅ All visibility via Phase 4A
	•	✅ UI is declarative & controlled

⛔ HARD STOP

After submitting the report:

⛔ STOP
⛔ Do NOT proceed to Partner UI
⛔ Await explicit authorization

⸻

If anything blocks cloning or pushing, STOP and report.
